# Perseverance

A minimalistic and streamlined [Jcink](https://jcink.com) theme intended for use in play-by-post role-playing games. This theme aims for accessibility, and to showcase writing as the star and focus. It will be suitable for use in and of itself, but could also be used as a base for even further theme development.

This theme is being developed in the open. That means you've got access to it now, during its development, instead of starting after its first stable release. Things may look and feel messy for a while as all the pieces come together, and that's okay. You can follow along here to see the details of that process if you'd like. You can even spin off a fork and tinker with taking this theme in your own direction at any point, so long as you stick to the [license](LICENSE) (which is intentionally very open).

A demo of the most recent iteration of this theme can be seen on the [Magrathea test site](https://magratheaguide.jcink.net).
